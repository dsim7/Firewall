# Firewall

Endless runner mobile game made with Unity3D

### How to play:

Tap the sides of the screen to move left and right to move.

The circles on the bottom of the screen indicate are your "buffers". There is one buffer for each of the 3 colored lanes.

When you run into a red tile, the buffer of the color of the lane you are in will take a hit. If any buffer reaches 0 it's game over.

Buffers will regenerate if you stay out of that lane for a time.

Points accumulate slowly over time. Collecting the blue boxes will give a burst of points.
